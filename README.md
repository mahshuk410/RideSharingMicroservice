# RideSharingMicroservice

## Description of the Ride-Sharing App
The ride-sharing application adopts a microservice architecture where each REST API represents a distinct microservice. They are broken into Driver API, Passenger API and Trips Management API.
The driver API allows drivers to manage their account details(create and update), view assigned trips, start and end these trips. 
Whereas the Passenger API allows users to register their Passenger Accounts, update their account details, request for trips from one destination to another as well as view their trip history.


## Microservice Architecture Diagram
![Architecture-diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73008987/208143360-123538d0-443e-42ca-af4a-983a1583f5af.png)
A Component-based front-end is built for drivers and passengers. All communications to microservices will be made from the Driver and Passenger UI over RESTful APIs. The console UIs will be running on PowerShell/ Command Prompt Terminals. Each of the microservices were developed using the Golang. For each microservice, a REST API has been created. All the databases are developed using MySQL engine. 

## Setting Up Microservices
1.	Download and Execute the MySQL Database Script 
2.	Download and Execute the driver-service.go, passenger-service.go and trip-service.go.
NOTE: Run all of these microservices simultaneously on separate VS code/PowerShell/command prompt terminals
NOTE: Open all the above-mentioned go files from the folder level to import all module dependencies. 
3.	Allow the firewall connections through ports when prompted by Windows Firewall Security:  

| PORT | MICROSERVICE           |
|------|------------------------|
| 5000 | Passenger Microservice |
| 5002 | Driver Microservice    | 
| 5003 | Trip Microservice      |


4.	Download and execute the Driver.go and Passenger.go console files.
NOTE: Open all the above-mentioned go files from the folder level to import all module dependencies. 
5.	Tools Required: 
 -  Postman – Test the APIs
 -  Visual Studio Code – Open the Microservice and console programs
 -  Golang extension on Visual Studio Code– to import dependencies
 -  MySQL Workbench – to run the MySQL database scripts
